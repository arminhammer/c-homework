Homework projects written in C

This project contains some homework projects that I did in school for one of my classes.
All four assignments are written in C.  These homework assignments are not useful on their own,
but may prove useful as a reference.

The final project may be of most interest.  It is a very limited http server that only supports GET and HEAD
requests.  It is multi-threaded and in pure C, with no external requirements.
