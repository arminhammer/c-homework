Some multithreading in ihttpd.c inspired from http://www.mario-konrad.ch/wiki/
doku.php?id=programming:multithreading:tutorial-04
//ihttpd.c based on http://cs.gmu.edu/~mabdulla/courses/2014/563/code/daemons/
concurrent-echo-server.c

Took file reading code from http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Read_entire_file#C

The string trim() function is from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Trimming_(computer_programming)

==================================================
All of the problems in the assignment prompts were solved.  

The Makefile will build the ihttpd app and the attacker1 program when 'make' 
is invoked.  attacker1 tests command line options.  I have also included 
attacker2.sh, attacker3.sh, attacker4.sh, attacker5.sh, and attacker6.sh, 
which are bash scripts that test HTTP inputs.  

==================================================

A sample config.cfg is provided.  You can use the -c or --config flags to feed
a config file to the server.  Please use the format used in config.cfg

==================================================

The /mod folder is the location for dynamic modules.  rev.so is already
available there (made with 'make').  By default the mod folder will be a
subfolder of the document root, unless specified by -m.

==================================================

A number of test files are provided in the /testfiles folder.  When the 
server starts up, they will be available at localhost:1080/testfiles/

==================================================

The ihttpd.log is generated at server startup in the document root if it
does not already exist.  The server puts an flock on the log file at the start.

==================================================

The server can be started with ./ihttpd .  It will be moved to the background
but stdout is not redirected, so it should still print out.  It can be 
started as nohup ./ihttpd & as well.

==================================================

To stop the server, please kill -9 the process, or use killall ihttpd.
