All of the problems in the assignment prompts were solved.  

The Makefile will build the speller app and the attacker programs when 'make' is invoked.  attacker1 tests command line options, and attacker2 tests stdin inputs.

The LevenshteinDistance algorithm I used is from Wikipedia, as is the hashing function.

The string trim() function is from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimming_(computer_programming)

The bases for the list and hashmap data structures were inspired by http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/, but were modified extensively
