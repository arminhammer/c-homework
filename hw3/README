All of the problems in the assignment prompts were solved.  

The Makefile will build the arminsh app and the attacker programs when 'make' is invoked.  attacker1 tests command line options, and attacker2 tests stdin inputs.  make stacktest is there 
to test the stack code, but is not meant to be executed

The string trim() function is from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimming_(computer_programming)

The fork code is based on http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/unix/fork/fork7.cpp

The shell will print out the current directory, followed by a $ sign.  This is meant to imitate bash behavior, and makes it easier
for the user to tell in which directory they are currently in.
